## Overview

Koog is a Kotlin-based framework designed to build and run AI agents entirely in idiomatic Kotlin and Java API. It lets you create agents that can interact with tools, handle complex workflows, and communicate with users.

### Key features

Key features of Koog include:

- **Multiplatform development**: Deploy agents across JVM, JS, WasmJS, Android, and iOS targets using Kotlin Multiplatform.
- **Reliability and fault-tolerance**: Handle failures with built-in retries and restore the agent state at specific points during execution with the agent persistence feature.
- **Intelligent history compression**: Optimize token usage while maintaining context in long-running conversations using advanced built-in history compression techniques.
- **Enterprise-ready integrations**: Utilize integration with popular JVM frameworks such as Spring Boot and Ktor to embed Koog into your applications.
- **Observability with OpenTelemetry exporters**: Monitor and debug applications with built-in support for popular observability providers (W&B Weave, Langfuse).
- **LLM switching and seamless history adaptation**: Switch to a different LLM at any point without losing the existing conversation history, or reroute between multiple LLM providers.
- **Integration with JVM and Kotlin applications**: Build AI agents with an idiomatic, type-safe Kotlin DSL designed specifically for JVM and Kotlin developers.
- **Model Context Protocol integration**: Use Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools in AI agents.
- **Agent Client Protocol integration**: Build ACP-compliant agents that can communicate with standardized client applications using the Agent Client Protocol (ACP).
- **Knowledge retrieval and memory**: Retain and retrieve knowledge across conversations using vector embeddings, RAG, and shared agent memory.
- **Powerful Streaming API**: Process responses in real-time with streaming support and parallel tool calls.
- **Modular feature system**: Customize agent capabilities through a composable architecture.
- **Flexible graph workflows**: Design complex agent behaviors using intuitive graph-based workflows.
- **Custom tool creation**: Enhance your agents with tools that access external systems and APIs.
- **Comprehensive tracing**: Debug and monitor agent execution with detailed, configurable tracing.

### Available LLM providers and platforms

The LLM providers and platforms whose LLMs you can use to power your agent capabilities:

- Google
- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- DeepSeek
- OpenRouter
- Ollama
- Bedrock

### Quickstart example

To help you get started with AI agents, here is a quick example:

```kotlin
fun main() = runBlocking {
    // Before you run the example, assign a corresponding API key as an environment variable.
   val apiKey = System.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") // or Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, etc.

   val agent = AIAgent(
      promptExecutor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(apiKey), // or Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, etc.
      systemPrompt = "You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions concisely.",
      llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o
   )

   val result = agent.run("Hello! How can you help me?")
   println(result)
}
```

## Using in your projects

### Supported targets

Currently, the framework supports the JVM, JS, WasmJS and iOS targets.

### Requirements

- JDK 17 or higher is required to use the framework on JVM.
- Kotlin 2.3.10 or higher should be set explicitly in existing projects. Please check the [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml) to know more about Kotlin dependencies (currently it uses kotlinx-coroutines 1.10.2, kotlinx-serialization 1.10.0 and kotlinx-datetime 0.7.1)

### Gradle (Kotlin DSL)

1. Add dependencies to the `build.gradle.kts` file:

    ```
    dependencies {
        implementation("ai.koog:koog-agents:0.7.3")
    }
    ```
2. Make sure that you have `mavenCentral()` in the list of repositories.
### Gradle (Groovy)

1. Add dependencies to the `build.gradle` file:

    ```
    dependencies {
        implementation 'ai.koog:koog-agents:0.7.3'
    }
    ```
2. Make sure that you have `mavenCentral()` in the list of repositories.
### Maven

1. Add dependencies to the `pom.xml` file:

    ```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>ai.koog</groupId>
        <artifactId>koog-agents-jvm</artifactId>
        <version>0.7.3</version>
    </dependency>
    ```
2. Make sure that you have `mavenCentral` in the list of repositories.

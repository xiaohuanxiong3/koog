!!! note
    Koog supports the most commonly used capabilities for creating AI agents.
    LLMs from each provider may have additional features that Koog does not currently support.
    To learn more, refer to [Model capabilities](model-capabilities.md).

## Working with providers

Koog lets you work with LLM providers on two levels:

* Using an **LLM client** for direct interaction with a specific provider.
  Each client implements the `LLMClient` interface, handling authentication, 
  request formatting, and response parsing for the provider.
  For details, see [LLM clients](prompts/llm-clients.md).

  * Using a **prompt executor** for a higher-level abstraction that wraps one or multiple LLM clients,
    manages their lifecycles, and unifies an interface across providers.
    It can switch between providers
    and optionally fall back to a configured provider and LLM using the corresponding client.
    You can either create your own executor or use a pre-defined prompt executor for a specific provider.
    For details, see [Prompt executors](prompts/prompt-executors.md).


Using a prompt executor offers a higher‑level layer over one or more LLMClients. 
It manages client lifecycles and exposes a unified interface across providers. 
In multi‑provider setups, it can route requests between providers and optionally fall back to a designated
client when needed for core requests. You can create your own executor or use pre‑defined ones—both single‑provider
and multi‑provider options are available.

## Next steps

- [Create and run an agent](quickstart.md) with a specific LLM provider.
- Learn more about [prompts](prompts/index.md).

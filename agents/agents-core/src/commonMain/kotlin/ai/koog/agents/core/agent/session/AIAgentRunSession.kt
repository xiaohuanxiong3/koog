 * Represents a session for running an [ai.koog.agents.core.agent.AIAgent].
 *
 * An [AIAgentRunSession] encapsulates a single execution lifecycle of an AI agent, providing
 * a controlled environment for running the agent's strategy with specific input and context.
 * Each session is independent and manages its own execution state, pipeline coordination,
 * and resource lifecycle.
 *
 * Sessions are typically created through [ai.koog.agents.core.agent.AIAgentBase.createSession]
 * and can be reused for multiple sequential executions. The session handles:
 * - Pipeline preparation and feature initialization
 * - Strategy execution with proper error handling
 * - Event notifications at each execution stage
 * - Resource cleanup after execution completes
 *
 * @param Input the type of input data required by the agent's strategy.
 * @param Output the type of output data produced by the agent's strategy.
 * @param TContext the type of context used during execution, extending [AIAgentContext].
 *
 * @see ai.koog.agents.core.agent.AIAgentBase.createSession

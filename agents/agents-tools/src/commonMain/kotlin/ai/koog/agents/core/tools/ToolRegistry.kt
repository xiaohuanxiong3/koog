/**
 * A registry that manages a collection of tools for use by agents.
 *
 * ToolRegistry serves as a central repository for all tools available to an agent.
 * It provides functionality to register tools and retrieve them by name or type.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Maintains a unique collection of named tools
 * - Provides methods to retrieve tools by name or type
 * - Supports merging multiple registries
 *
 * Usage examples:
 * 1. Creating a registry:
 *    ```
 *    val registry = ToolRegistry {
 *        tool(MyCustomTool())
 *        tool(AnotherTool())
 *    }
 *    ```
 * 2. Merging registries:
 *    ```
 *    val combinedRegistry = registry1 + registry2
 *    ```
 *
 * @property tools The list of tools contained in this registry

/**
 * Represents a detailed implementation of [ai.koog.agents.core.feature.message.FeatureMessage] that encapsulates a string message.
 *
 * This class associates a string content with a specific feature-related message type, along with
 * a timestamp indicating when the message was created.
 *
 * It is primarily used for text-based feature messages and integrates with the [ai.koog.agents.core.feature.message.FeatureMessage]
 * interface to define its structure.
 *
 * Instances of this type are timestamped at the moment of their creation, ensuring consistent
 * temporal tracking for feature messages.
 *
 * @property message The textual message content encapsulated by this feature message.
 * @property timestamp The time at which this message was created has represented in milliseconds since the epoch.
